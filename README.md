# flotE
The current method for tracking finishing times in a boat race presents two problems: (1) two people are required for timekeeping, one for keeping time and the other for recording results; and (2) the finish line is not clearly visible from shore, resulting in a delay between when a boat finishes and when viewers receive its finishing time. Our clients proposed flotE to solve these problems. The application has two main features: administration and timekeeping. flotE helps users organize and save regattas, races, and participants, in addition to providing a way to search these stored records. The application also provides timekeeping capabilities: a built-in stopwatch and boat ID suggestions as the user types allow a single user to timekeep a race on their own; additionally, as results are recorded, they are posted to the application in real time for viewers to see.
